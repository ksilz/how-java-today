## We Pick More Technologies & Tools More Often Today
Java or Kotlin? Microservices or monolith? Relational databases or NoSQL? Spring Boot or Quarkus/Micronaut/MicroProfile/Helidon? Imperative or reactive? REST or GraphQL? Which Java distribution? And which Java version? And how do the cloud, containers, and DevOps fit into all of this?

That is a lot of questions for us Java developers! And not only do we have to pick all these **technologies & tools**. We also have to do this **more often** now!<br/><br/>


## Your Story Helps Other Developers!
This site is a place where the Java community comes together and shares advice. We start by collecting **case studies**!

So if you worked on a Java project, please ask yourself: Can your peers learn from this? If so, then **take our Java case study survey**:

## How Can You Share Your Story?
1. You start by filling out the survey.
1. We then review your submission and turn it into a **draft** case study.
1. Together with you, we edit the draft case study.
1. You have the final say if your case study gets published and what's in it!
1. If you authorize it, then we publish your case study on this site.
